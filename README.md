# prog1-2023-shell
This repo branch contains the shell for program 1 from cg class 2023 at nc state (ray tracing ellipsoids).

Currently I have been implementing ray casting for the triangles and triangles2 json files
I believe there is at least one source of error in my math which is why the triangles
are being rendered incorrectly. I would appreciate and feedback or guidance on that matter.
